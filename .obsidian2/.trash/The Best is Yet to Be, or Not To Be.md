- In 2009, the Australian government announced an ambitious project to provide super-fast fiber-based Internet to 93% of the population; in 2013, it revised the plan to reuse existing copper wire; in 2025, many Australians [still have no (or slow) Internet](https://www.theregister.com/2020/12/23/australian_national_broadband_network_complete/). First promise big things, then revise the promise to make them little things, then don’t finish them anyway. This isn’t (we hope) a description of the World Scholar’s Cup curriculum release process, but a pattern of behavior for governments all over the world. Discuss with your team: is it better to underpromise and overdeliver, or vice versa?
- Don’t worry, Australia—you’re not alone. (More on loneliness later.) In Canada, a proposed high-speed rail network had its target speed slashed before being rebranded as a [high _frequency_](https://thewalrus.ca/high-speed-rail/) network. In many developed countries, ambitious projects have [gone out of fashion](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/bertha-seattle-infrastructure-trouble-megaprojects) in favor of slow, incremental ones. Check out the mega projects below, as well as those from your own country, then discuss with your team: is this shift in approach justified? How might megaprojects (or their failure) affect the way people [perceive progress?](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02513625.2019.1630189#d1e235) And are some countries more consistently successful at these projects?

- Big Dig | Channel Tunnel | California High-Speed Rail
- Sejong City | Hambantota | NEOM | Khazar Islands
- Three Gorges Dam | Hong Kong-Zhuhai Bridge | New Eurasia Land Bridge

- Sometimes social distancing is the problem. In 2023, the World Health Organization declared loneliness a pressing [global health threat](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/nov/16/who-declares-loneliness-a-global-public-health-concern). Explore how this concern varies [around the world](https://www.sciencealert.com/global-review-finds-loneliness-is-a-common-and-harrowing-issue-we-are-overlooking), then discuss with your team: do you agree that there is a “loneliness epidemic”—and, if so, how can it be treated?
- Some countries have tried tackling the problem with technology—and [none more so than Japan](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/japan-loneliness-aging-robots-technology_n_5b72873ae4b0530743cd04aa). Explore [efforts to “fix” loneliness](https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/01/09/1065135/japan-automating-eldercare-robots/) in Japan and elsewhere, then discuss with your team: are they the sorts of solutions that more societies should adopt? What technologies would you design to achieve the same aims?
- In 2021, the UN Development Programme found that living conditions in [90% of the world's countries](https://www.dw.com/en/un-index-shows-living-standards-declining-in-90-of-countries/a-63052023) had declined for the second year in a row—possibly contributing to [declining birth rates](https://www.insights.uca.org.au/is-the-cost-of-living-crisis-just-the-new-normal/). Discuss with your team: is [this decline irreversible](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-population-decrease-is-irreversible-how-will-we-manage-the-decline-of/) or will the world’s population begin to boom again? Should we want it to?
- During the Covid pandemic, podcasts exploded in popularity. Their hosts (or at least their subtly-enhanced voices) became [many people’s closest friends](https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/jun/07/tragic-but-true-have-podcasters-replaced-our-real-friends) in a solitary time. Discuss with your team: are podcasts meaningfully different from old-fashioned radio broadcasts in their impact on society, and will their impact continue? In other words, how dated will this bullet seem, ten years from now?)
- Speaking of bullets, the man who eventually assassinated American President James Garfield, Charles Guiteau, was certain they had a close personal connection (which, of course, Garfield never knew about.) The Internet has [driven a surge](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/modern-mentality/201810/is-social-media-making-you-lonely) in these one-sided “parasocial” relationships. Algorithms on these platforms are designed to boost engagement and view time, even if the content is [harmful or raises false hopes](https://hai.stanford.edu/news/psychiatrists-perspective-social-media-algorithms-and-mental-health). Explore how social media also affects the health of [adults and seniors](https://www.harvardmagazine.com/2022/02/right-now-social-media-adult-depression), then discuss with your team: who should be held responsible when an algorithm [promotes harmful content](https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/24121461/myanmar-genocide-section-230-facebook-internet-social-media-moderation)? Could you design an algorithm to craft a healthier, happier society—and would it be successful?
- How often do you pick up your phone to check a fact or answer a question during a meal with friends or family? Can you imagine living in a world where things just—stay mysterious, and where you have no idea what is happening a thousand miles away? Researchers have found that the oversaturation of news, especially of negative stories, [leads to constant stress](https://www.apa.org/monitor/2022/11/strain-media-overload) and a [skewed worldview](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200512-how-the-news-changes-the-way-we-think-and-behave), especially when they contain [violent images and videos](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/psychology-through-technology/202402/traumatic-media-overload-could-impact-our-mental-health). Discuss with your team: to protect people’s mental health, should the government (or others) limit the amount of information we can consume?
